# interlayer_energies_demo



## interlayer_energies/data/qmc.csv Extrapolated QMC energies:
These energies are extrapolated in finite size and timesteps have been checked

### Columns 
* energy: eV/atom
* energy_err: eV/atom
* finite_size_correction : eV/atom : the difference between the largest calculation done and the extrapolated infinite value
* d: distance between the layers (angstrom)
* disregistry: 
     * 0.0 : AB stacking
     * 1/6: SP stacking
     * 2/3: AA stacking
